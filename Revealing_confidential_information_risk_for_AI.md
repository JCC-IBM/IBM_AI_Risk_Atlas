# Revealing confidential information risk for AI

**Risks associated with output** \
**Intellectual property** \
**Amplified by generative AI**

### Description

When confidential information is used in training data, fine-tuning data, or as part of the prompt, models might reveal that data in the generated output. Revealing confidential information is a type of data leakage.

### Why is revealing confidential information a concern for foundation models?

If not properly developed to secure confidential data, the model might reveal confidential information or IP in the generated output and reveal information that was meant to be secret.
