# Harmful code generation risk for AI

**Risks associated with output** \
**Harmful code generation** \
**New to generative AI**

### Description

Models might generate code that causes harm or unintentionally affects other systems.

### Why is harmful code generation a concern for foundation models?

The execution of harmful code might open vulnerabilities in IT systems. Business entities might face fines, reputational harms, disruption to operations, and other legal consequences.

### Example - Generation of Less Secure Code

According to their paper, researchers at Stanford University investigated the impact of code-generation tools on code quality and found that programmers tend to include more bugs in their final code when they use AI assistants. These bugs might increase the code's security vulnerabilities, yet the programmers believed their code to be more secure.
