### Description

Determining ownership of AI-generated content.

### Why is generated content ownership a concern for foundation models?

Laws and regulations that relate to the ownership of AI-generated content are largely unsettled and can vary from country to country. Business entities might face fines, reputational risks, disruption to operations, and other legal consequences.

### Example - Determining Ownership of AI Generated Image

According to the news article, AI-generated art became controversial after an AI-generated work of art won the Colorado State Fairâ€™s art competition in 2022. The piece was generated by Midjourney, a generative AI image tool, following prompts from the artist. The win raised questions about copyright issues. In other words, if all the artist did was come up with a description of the art, but the AI tool generated it, who owns the rights to the generated image? According to the latest article, The U.S. Copyright Office rejected copyright protection for the art created with artificial intelligence because it was not the product of human authorship.
