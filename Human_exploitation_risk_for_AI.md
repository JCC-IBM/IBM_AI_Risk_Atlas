# Human exploitation risk for AI

**Non-technical risks** \
**Societal impact** \
**Amplified by generative AI**

### Description

Use of ghost work in training AI models, inadequate working conditions, lack of health care incl. mental health, unfair compensation.

### Why is human exploitation a concern for foundation models?

Foundation models still depend on human labor to source, manage, and program the data that is used to train the model. Human exploitation for these activities might negatively impact the society and human welfare. Moreover, business entities might face fines, reputational risks, disruption to operations, and other legal consequences.

### Example - Low-wage workers for data annotation

Based on a review of internal documents and employees' interviews by TIME media, the data labelers that are employed by an outsourcing firm on behalf of OpenAI to identify toxic content were paid a take-home wage of between around $1.32 and $2 per hour, depending on seniority and performance. TIME stated that workers are mentally scarred as they were shown toxic and violent content, including graphic details of “child sexual abuse, bestiality, murder, suicide, torture, self-harm, and incest”.
