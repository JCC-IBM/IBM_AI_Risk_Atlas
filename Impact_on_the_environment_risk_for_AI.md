# Impact on the environment risk for AI

**Non-technical risks** \
**Societal impact** \
**Amplified by generative AI**

### Description

Increased carbon emission and water usage to train and operate AI models.

### Why is impact on the environment a concern for foundation models?

Consuming large amounts of energy for AI training contributes to carbon emissions that might accelerate climate change. Water resources that are used for cooling AI data center servers can no longer be allocated for other necessary uses.
