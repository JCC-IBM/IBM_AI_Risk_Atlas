### Description

Determining who is responsible for the foundation model.

### Why is legal accountability a concern for foundation models?

If ownership for development of the model is uncertain, regulators and others might have concerns about the model. It would not be clear who would be liable and responsible for the problems with it or can answer questions about it. Users of models without clear ownership might find challenges with compliance with future AI regulation.
