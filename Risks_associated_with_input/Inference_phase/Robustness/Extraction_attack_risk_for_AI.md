# Extraction attack risk for AI

**Risks associated with input** \
**Inference** \
**Robustness** \
**Amplified by generative AI**

### Description

An extraction attack attempts to copy or steal an AI model by appropriately sampling the input space and observing outputs to build a surrogate model that behaves similarly.

### Why is extraction attack a concern for foundation models?

With a successful attack, the attacker can gain valuable information such as sensitive personal information or intellectual property.
