# Job loss risk for AI

**Non-technical risks** \
**Societal impact** \
**Amplified by generative AI**

### Description

Widespread adoption of foundation model-based AI systems might lead to people's job loss as their work is automated if they are not reskilled.

### Why is job loss a concern for foundation models?

Job loss might lead to a loss of income and thus might negatively impact the society and human welfare. Reskilling might be challenging given the pace of the technology evolution.

### Example - Replacing Human Workers

According to the news article, AI technology replicating individuals' faces and voices is becoming more prominent in Hollywood. The actorsâ€™ concerns highlight a broader anxiety among entertainers and people in many other creative professions. Many fear that without strict regulation, their work gets replicated and remixed by artificial intelligence tools. Transformation on that scale will cut their control over their work and hurts their ability to earn a living. One of their key concerns is AI replacing non-speaking background roles by instead using a digital likeness.
