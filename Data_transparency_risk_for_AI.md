# Data transparency risk for AI

**Risks associated with input** \
**Training and tuning phase** \
**Transparency** \
**Amplified by generative AI**

### Description

Without accurate documentation on how a model's data was collected, curated, and used to train a model, it might be harder to satisfactorily explain the behavior of the model with respect to the data.

### Why is data transparency a concern for foundation models?

Data transparency is important for legal compliance and AI ethics. Missing information limits the ability to evaluate risks associated with the data. The lack of standardized requirements might limit disclosure as organizations protect trade secrets and try to limit others from copying their models.

### Example - Data and Model Metadata Disclosure

OpenAI's technical report is an example of the dichotomy around disclosing data and model metadata. While many model developers see value in enabling transparency for consumers, disclosure poses real safety issues and might increase the ability to misuse the models. In the GPT-4 technical report, the authors state: “Given both the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4, this report contains no further details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, data set construction, training method, or similar.”
