# Personal information in data risk for AI

**Risks associated with input** \
**Training and tuning phase** \
**Privacy** \
**Traditional AI risk**

### Description

Inclusion or presence of personal identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personal information (SPI)â€¯in the data used for training or fine tuning the model might result in unwanted disclosure of that information.

### Why is personal information in data a concern for foundation models?

If not properly developed to protect sensitive data, the model might expose personal information in the generated output. Additionally, personal or sensitive data must be reviewed and handled with respect to privacy laws and regulations, as business entities could face fines, reputational harms, and other legal consequences if found in violation.

### Example - Training on Private Information

According to the article, Google and its parent company Alphabet were accused in a class-action lawsuit of misusing vast amount of personal information and copyrighted material. The information was taken from hundreds of millions of internet users to train its commercial AI products, which include Bard, its conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot. This case follows similar lawsuits that are filed against Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and OpenAI over their alleged misuse of personal data.
