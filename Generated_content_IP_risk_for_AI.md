### Description

Legal uncertainty about intellectual property rights related to generated content

### Why is generated content ip a concern for foundation models?

Laws and regulations for the copyrightability, and patentability of the AI-generated content are largely unsettled and can vary from country to country. Business entities might face fines, reputational risks, disruption to operation, and other legal consequences if the generated content is covered by IP rights.

### Example - Role of AI systems in Patenting Generated Content

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's refusal to issue patents for inventions created by an AI system. According to the scientist, his AI system created unique prototypes for a beverage holder and emergency light beacon entirely on its own. The justices rejected the appeal of a lower court's ruling that patents can be issued only to human inventors and that the scientist's AI system could not be considered the legal creator of two inventions it generated. According to the cited article, the UKâ€™s Intellectual Property Office also refused to grant a patent on the grounds that the inventor must be a human or a company, rather than a machine.
