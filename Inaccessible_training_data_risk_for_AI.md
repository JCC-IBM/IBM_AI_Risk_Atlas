# Inaccessible training data risk for AI

**Risks associated with output** \
**Explainability** \
**Amplified by generative AI**

### Description

Without access to the training data, the types of explanations a model can provide are limited and more likely to be incorrect.

### Why is inaccessible training data a concern for foundation models?

Low quality explanations without source data make it difficult for users, model validators, and auditors to understand and trust the model.
