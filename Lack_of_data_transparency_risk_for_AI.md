# Lack of data transparency risk for AI

**Non-technical risks** \
**Governance** \
**Amplified by generative AI**

### Description

Insufficient documentation of the data that is used for model training makes it difficult to comply with legal requirements, including explaining the representativeness of data and the expected model behavior.

### Why is lack of data transparency a concern for foundation models?

Transparency is important for legal compliance and AI ethics. Missing information might make it more difficult to evaluate representational harms, data ownership, and provenance.
