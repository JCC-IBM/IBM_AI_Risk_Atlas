**Risks associated with output** \
**Intellectual property** \
**New to generative AI**

### Description

When a model generates content that is too similar or identical to existing work protected by copyright or covered by an open source license agreement.

### Why is copyright infringement a concern for foundation models?

Laws and regulations that concern the use of content that looks the same or similar to other copyrighted data are largely unsettled and can vary from country to country, providing challenges in determining and implementing compliance. Business entities might face fines, reputational harms, disruption to operations, and other legal consequences.
