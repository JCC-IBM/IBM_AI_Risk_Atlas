# Unreliable source attribution risk for AI

**Risks associated with output**
**Explainability**
**Amplified by generative AI**

### Description

Source attribution is the AI system's ability to describe from what training data it generated a portion or all its output. Since current techniques are based on approximations, these attributions might be incorrect.

### Why is unreliable source attribution a concern for foundation models?

Low quality explanations make it difficult for users, model validators, and auditors to understand and trust the model.
