# Untraceable attribution risk for AI

**Risks associated with output** \
**Explainability** \

### Description

The original entity from which training data comes from might not be known, limiting the utility and success of source attribution techniques.

### Why is untraceable attribution a concern for foundation models?

The inability to provide the provenance for an explanation makes it difficult for users, model validators, and auditors to understand and trust the model.
