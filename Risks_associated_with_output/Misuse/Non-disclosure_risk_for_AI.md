# Non-disclosure risk for AI

**Risks associated with output** \
**Misuse** \
**New to generative AI**

### Description

Not disclosing that content is generated by an AI model.

### Why is non-disclosure a concern for foundation models?

Not disclosing the AI-authored content reduces trust and is deceptive. Intentional deception might result in decreased human agency, fines, reputational harms, and other legal consequences.

### Example - Undisclosed AI Interaction

According to the source article, an online emotional support chat service ran a study to augment or write responses to around 4,000 users by using GPT-3 without informing users. The co-founder faced immense public backlash about the potential for harm that is caused by AI-generated chats to the already vulnerable users. He claimed that the study was "exempt" from informed consent law.
